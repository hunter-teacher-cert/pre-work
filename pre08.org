Chapter 9 of Think Java deals with String manipulations. You don't
explicitly need it for this section but you should review it prior to
starting our program.



Create a directory named ~pre08~ in your assignments folder. 

You will write a program named ~Craps.java~ that will play a
simplified game of craps. 

There should be at least three static methods in addition to ~main~. One
named ~roll~ which accepts an integer parameter and returns a random
number between 1 and that number, inclusive. There should also be one
named ~shoot~ which accepts two parameters - a number of dice and the
maximum value for those dice and returns the result of rolling those dice. 

The third method should be named ~round~. It should accept no
parameters and it should return something to indicate if the shooter
of the round wins or loses.  

A round is played as follows:

The shooter shoots (rolls) two dice. 
  - If he rolls a sum of 2,3, or 12,that's Craps and he loses.
  - If he rolls a sum of 7 or 11, that's a Natural and he wins.
Otherwise:
  - the value he rolled is now called the Point
  - the shooter continues to shoot (roll) until he either rolls the
    Point again at which point he wins or he rolls a 7 at which point
    he loses. 

The main program should take a parameter from the command line, play
that many rounds and as it plays indicate each time the shooter wins
or loses. The program should also print out the status of the rounds
they occur. 

For more information, here's a great documentary on the subject:

When done, add and push Craps.java to GitHub.
